# FindDiff Application#
## Required software and toolboxes ##

> download MATLAB_R2021a by following the steps from https://syncandshare.lrz.de/dl/fiC8Bbg6NUXLbTu9CL5b1Yg4/TAH_HowTo.pdf or from https://de.mathworks.com

> install the preprocessing , the computer vision , and the statistics and machine learning toolboxes.


## Application usage ##

> open "group32" folder 

> extract everything and import datasets from moodle in the same folder

> open appcvversion2.mlapp file

> chose between detect changes on 2 images or the whole dataset

> click on import to give the path of the image

> select from the "Apply the algorithm" options

> Select Mode of visualtisation: 

1. Difference-Highlights: Highlight changes in a green color on top of one of the chosen images

2. Gray-scale: Get a change map only in grayscale

3. Time-lapse (only applicable for choosing Dataset in the first step): ALlgorithm goes through the whole dataset and produces a video with highlighted changes in all pairs of images

> If available set the slider to desired value

> Select Mode of change:

1. city/countryside: City option finds changes in the datasets with cities and countryside option respectively

2. large/small: detect larger or smaller changes in the images 

3. quick/slow: Quick option detects changes in images with a small gap of years and slow option with a bigger gap respectively

4. with preprocessing: If applied, preprocessing is used on images before the change detection algorithm

> If available set the slider to desired value (100 is optimal for pca parameters)

> Click "Apply" Button

> You can see the result in the result section alongside with a report of the methods used, mode of visualisation and mode of change

> If the whole set is imported, you can control the images using the slider in the results box

> You can export the resulting images in different formats

NB: please wait until the execution of the program is terminated before changing settings (until you can see the output in the results box)

NB: It is recommended for better results to use PCA K-means as well as image differencing with the optimal (default) paramteres, otherwise execution time or results will be suboptimal

NB: Results may differ according to the order of the selected images. (Change order if performance is poor)
